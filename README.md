This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an Excel file and creating visualizations to gain insights into sales performance, trends, and patterns. It showcases the use of Python and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization tasks.

### Project Structure

1. **sales_data.xlsx**: Excel file containing the sales data.
2. **data_processing.py**: Python script for data processing tasks.
3. **data_visualization.py**: Python script for creating visualizations.
4. **sales_report.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for compiling visualizations and insights into a report.
5. **requirements.txt**: File containing required Python packages.
6. **sample_data.xlsx**: Sample Excel file for testing purposes.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `data_processing.py` script to process the data.
4. Run the `data_visualization.py` script to generate visualizations.
5. Open and run the `sales_report.ipynb` notebook to compile insights and create a report.

### Usage

- Modify the `sales_data.xlsx` file with your own sales data.
- Customize the data processing and visualization scripts as needed.
- Use the Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize the sales data, and generate reports.
